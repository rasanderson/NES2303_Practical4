## Generalised linear models
Generalised linear models covering theory (mainly in shiny app) and simple examples of Poisson and binomial

## Changes or edits
* Probably needs few changes, but should lognormal be added?
* QQ plots often hard to interpret for GLMs. Should DHARMa package be offered as alternative?
